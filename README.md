# 802.11a
Software-Hardware Implementation of IEEE 802.11a Wifi Standard


## Software
This section is containing some MATLAB codes which simulates the Wifi protocol. It was my Communication Systems  course Project (Dr. Pakravan - Fall 2020).

## Hardware
This section contains Verilog codes and Matlab test codes for obtaining a implementation of 802.11a protocol using. It was my FPGA-ASIC course Project (Dr. Shabani - Spring 2021).
