# 802.11a
Software-Hardware Implementation of IEEE 802.11a Wifi Standard


## [Software](https://github.com/sadrasabouri/802.11a/tree/master/Sofware)
This section is containing some MATLAB codes which simulates the Wifi protocol. It was my Communication Systems  course Project (Dr. Pakravan - Fall 2020).

## [Hardware](https://github.com/sadrasabouri/802.11a/tree/master/Hardware)
This section contains Verilog codes and Matlab test codes for obtaining a implementation of 802.11a protocol using. It was my FPGA-ASIC course Project (Dr. Shabani - Spring 2021).
